# Model Artifact — Metro Flow Forecasting

## File
`metro_xgb_model.joblib` — the selected XGBoost model bundled with its metadata.

## What's inside
A Python dict saved with joblib:
- `model` — trained XGBRegressor
- `features` — ordered list of the 10 feature columns the model expects
- `model_type` — "XGBoost"
- `val_mae`, `test_mae` — recorded performance

## How to load and predict
```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

artifact = joblib.load("artifacts/metro_xgb_model.joblib")
model = artifact["model"]
features = artifact["features"]

# X must be a DataFrame containing exactly these columns, in this order:
# stationID, hour, minute, dayofweek, is_weekend,
# inflow_lag_1..4, inflow_roll_mean_4
prediction = model.predict(X[features])
```

## Input schema (features)
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| stationID | station identifier (0–80) |
| hour | hour of day (0–23) |
| minute | minute (0/15/30/45) |
| dayofweek | 0=Mon … 6=Sun |
| is_weekend | 1 if Sat/Sun else 0 |
| inflow_lag_1..4 | inflow 1–4 intervals (15–60 min) ago |
| inflow_roll_mean_4 | mean inflow of the previous 4 intervals |

## Output
Predicted inflow (passenger count) for the next 15-minute interval at that station.

## Reload proof
Loading this artifact and calling `.predict()` reproduces the original test
predictions exactly, with no retraining (verified via `np.allclose`). See
`notebooks/03_models.ipynb`.

## Retraining
To regenerate this artifact, run `notebooks/03_models.ipynb` end to end.
